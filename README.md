# React-based Frontend for a todo app
This application is used in the scope of different workshops.

To run the backend server do one of the following:
* Implement a server based on [OpenAPI spec](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devshred/todo-api-spring-kotlin/main/src/main/resources/todo-spec.yaml)
* run [sample app based on Spring/Kotlin](https://github.com/devshred/todo-api-spring-kotlin)
* run [sample app based on Quarkus](https://github.com/devshred/todo-api-quarkus)
* run [sample app based on Go](https://github.com/devshred/todo-api-go)
* run [sample app based on Spring/Java (native binary)](https://github.com/devshred/todo-api-spring-java)

## Run Frontend
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
